# A simple CLI tool to help with semver['ing] monorepos


## Why this tool

In most of my work, and reading a lot of articles on how monorepos 
are gaining popularity, this tool will help with providing semver tags for such scenarios.

While it's advertised as a semver tool monorepos, it can be used all kinds of 
semver tags for the standard `a/b/c/<semver_tag>`. This makes this cli a lot more useful and flexible for use in many usecases.
